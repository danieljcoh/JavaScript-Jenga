So if we have a function:

const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};

We can refactor the function to:

const squareNum = num => num * num;

//


    The parentheses around num have been removed, since it has a single parameter.
    The curly braces { } have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
    The return keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
