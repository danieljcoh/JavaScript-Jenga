/*
    A race is right around the corner: 
    Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). \
    They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

    Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
    All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

    Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
        Early adults run at 9:30 am.
        Late adults run at 11:00 am.
    Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
